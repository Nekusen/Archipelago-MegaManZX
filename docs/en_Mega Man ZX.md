# Mega Man ZX

## Where is the options page?

The [player options page for this game](../player-options) contains all the options you need to configure and export a
config file.

## What does randomization do to this game?

Mega Man ZX becomes an open world. The intro mission is skipped: a new game starts on the Transerver floor you chose in your
options with the model you chose, on Normal difficulty. The biometals, the
Card Keys and the Transerver destinations are items placed somewhere in the multiworld, and the game's collectables and missions are checks. 
Missions are accepted automatically when you enter their area, and they can be done and reported in any order. 

## What is the goal?

Defeat Serpent at the top of Slither Inc. (D-5). The gate from D-2 into the tower opens once you meet all your chosen
`goal_requirements`. You can pick any number of goal requirements from this list:

- `Biometals`: own `required_models_count` models from the models listed in `required_models`. With `require_full_models` a progressive model
  counts only once you hold both halves.
- `Secret Disks`: collect `required_secret_disks` Secret Disks out of the `total_secret_disks`
  (30) shuffled into the multiworld. 
- `Missions`: complete a number `required_missions` out of the 14 story missions available, in any
  order. The skipped intro mission and the final mission do not count.

The STATUS tab of the pause menu shows your progress, and a popup announces the moment the gate opens (you can also check your goal progress using the command `/mmzx_goal` in the
client). `goal_requirements` must list at least one requirement.

## What items and locations get randomized?

Items:

- Biometals: Model X, Model ZX, Model OX, and the progressive Model HX, FX, LX and PX. The first copy of a progressive
  model gives you the form; the second is the biometal's other half, which unlocks the level 2 charged attack and the
  full Weapon Energy bar. With `progressive_models` off each of the four is a single item that gives both at once.
- The Yellow, Green, Red, Blue and Purple Card Keys.
- Transerver Access for each of the 13 areas with a Transerver (A, B, C, D, E, F, G, I, K, L, M, O and X).
  The one of Area M is left out when `area_m_access` closes the seal.
- Four Life Ups, four Sub Tanks and the eight ITEM B chips.
- The eight usable items of the pause menu (ITEM A): Cake, Orange, Candy, Bread, Apple, E Tank, W Tank and
  Smelling Salts.
- With `mission_objectives: items`, the story objects (four Computer Chips, the Stuffed Animal and the Data Disks 1, 2
  and 3) and what four story events do (Area F Lock Hack, Sprinkler Key, Lava Flow Control and Area E Power Shutdown).
- Passwords, with `area_m_access: passwords`.
- E-Crystals and 1-Ups as filler.

Locations:

- The 95 Secret Disks.
- The four Life Ups and the three Sub Tanks found in the world.
- The eight places that hand out a usable item: the child (Cake), Lucia (Bread) and Max (Orange) in Area C, the
  crane game of H-3 (Candy), the tree of A-3 (Apple), the hanging doll of Prairie's room in X-2 (W Tank), and the
  Guardians Cédre in X-3 (E Tank, 200 E-Crystals) and Scombrésoce in X-1 (Smelling Salts, 20 E-Crystals).
- Obtaining each of the five biometals: Z from Giro, and H, F, L and P from either Pseudoroid of its pair.
- Completing 14 story missions (Destroy Model W is the goal itself, and the initial mission "Catch the Maverick" is skipped).
- Optionally (`mission_objectives`), the objects and events of the story missions: the four Computer Chips of
  Area B, the four guardians of Pass The Test (Oeillet, Carrelet, Congre and Thon) and the Stuffed Animal, the Data
  Disk in the terminal of F-3 and the ones Leganchor and Protectos leave behind, the thirteen people trapped in Area G,
  the generator of E-3 and the Lava Flow Control of K-1 (27 locations). With `items`, the terminal of F-3 and the
  sprinkler key of G-2 are two more.
- Optionally, the 133 pickups (energy capsules, weapon energy, E-Crystals and 1-Ups). Only the "big" pickups are considered. Small pickups from drops do not count.
  - 7 1-Ups
  - 45 Life Energy
  - 25 Weapon Energy
  - 56 E-Crystal

## What has been changed from the base game?

### Starting point

- New Game skips the whole introduction. You start on the Transerver floor chosen in your options
  with the model and the character from your options, on Normal difficulty.

### Items

- Pickups in the world show the item they hold: the game's own icon for a Life Up, Sub Tank, chip, biometal or Card
  Key, and the Archipelago logo for anything else (an arrow for progression, a cross for useful, grey for filler).
  The icons are part of the patched ROM, so they show even while the client is disconnected.
  With `mission_objectives` the Computer Chips and the Data Disks of J-5 and L-4 show theirs too.
- A pickup that holds a multiworld item cannot be sliced into small pieces with a weapon; once its check is sent
  and it is back to a normal refill, it breaks as usual.
- Items you receive and items you send are announced in the game's own popup without stopping play. The `notify_*`
  options and the `/mmzx_notify` command choose which items are announced and how much text is shown.
- Usable items: the objects handed out in the world are checks and give nothing; the usables you hold are the ones
  received from the multiworld. A usable you have used comes back the next time you open any Transerver console,
  even if you only cancel the menu. The townspeople give their object on the second or third talk, in human form;
  the Guardians answer when you stand a little to their left. The child who gives the cake moves to C-1 once you
  complete Save The People, as in the original game, and needs no birthday; Scombrésoce sells the salts once you
  complete Troop Reinforcement; neither goes away afterwards, and Cédre and Scombrésoce stay in the base during
  Protect HQ. Any attack shakes the tree of A-3 and its first fruit is the apple; any hit on the
  hanging doll of X-2 frees the W Tank; the crane game of H-3 gives the candy the first time you catch a prize.

### The "Open World" state

- The mission of an area is accepted automatically when you enter it (no need to select it from a transerver), so you can play the
  areas in any order without going back to the hub. You DO have to report missions on a transerver.
- "Replay Missions" in the transerver consoles lists the missions you have already reported (and the quests, as usual), so you can
  play any of them again: its objective and its boss come back. While a mission you picked there is under way, entering an area does
  not accept that area's mission; report or abort it to go back to normal.
  - "Abort Mission" only appears for a mission or quest you picked from that list. With the mission of an area under way the console
    shows its normal menu, and picking a mission from "Replay Missions" replaces the one you had.
- All bosses are spawned from the beginning, and you can start the fight with them from both sides.
  - The exception for this rule are Rayfly (B-2) and Giro (D-2).
    - Rayfly requires you to get the nearest "Computer Chip" to the boss area to spawn the boss.
      With `mission_objectives: items` it is the Computer Chip item that spawns it, not the ones lying in Area B.
    - Giro requires beating both mini-bosses in the area to spawn
- The MISSION tab of the pause menu gains a fast travel function by pressing "Y". It lets you travel to Transerver locations you've unlocked.
- About Area X:
  - The only way in logic considered to reach Area X is to have it as your starting point or receive the Transerver Access from the multiworld
  - Some story points where the teleport to Area X is granted have been patched
  - The missions "Troop Reinforcement" and "Repel the Army" teleport you to Area X on completion. This teleports are NOT considered in logic.
- Some story gates are open from the start:
  - The F-3 door
    - This means you don't need to beat the mini-boss in this area 
  - The G-2 door to G-4
    - These changes mean you don't have to rescue anyone in area G 
  - With `mission_objectives: items` the F-3 and G-2 doors are not open from the start: each opens with its item.
  - The M-1 seal (which normally requires all models), unless `area_m_access` closes it (see below)
  - The D-1 bridge
  - The sand fall that hides the pit from K-1 to K-2
  - The D-3 ladder up to the walkway that leads to Area O.
- Troop Reinforcement can be started from D-1, D-2 or D-3 without the base cutscene.
- "Protect HQ" becomes available, when you have completed and reported 4 of the "main" missions (the ones with Pseudoroids in them)
  - To start the mission, teleport to Area X and speak with Prairie (you should have seen the previous cutscene on any transerver when reporting a mission
  - If you take another area's mission in between, Protect HQ resumes as soon as you enter Area X again. The Transerver consoles show their normal menu during it, as for any other mission of an area.
- The gate from D-2 into the Slither Inc. tower opens once you meet your `goal_requirements`.
- With `skip_boss_rush` the Pseudoroid refights of the D-4 tower are skipped and the elevator climbs straight to D-5.
- The mini-bosses that guard a stretch of an area (the King Flyers of D-2, the Lava Demon of K-2 and the others) come back every time you re-enter their area. With `skip_minibosses: after_first_defeat` each one stays beaten once you have beaten it; with `always` they all count as beaten from the start.
  - With `always` the Giro cutscene and boss fight at D-2 triggers right as you walk into it, since that fight required beating both mini bosses and this options marks them as defeated from the start.

### Mission objectives

With `mission_objectives` the objects and events of the story missions become checks.

- `checks`: picking up a Computer Chip, talking to each guardian of Pass The Test, getting the Stuffed Animal, using the
  terminal of F-3, rescuing each person of Area G, destroying the generator of E-3, setting the lava control of K-1 and
  picking up the Data Disks of J-5 and L-4 each send a check. Nothing else changes.
- `items`: the same, and what those things gave is now an item of the pool.
  - The Report of a mission needs its object: a Computer Chip for Locate Giro, the Stuffed Animal for Pass The Test and
    the Data Disk 1, 2 or 3 for Find The Survivors, Recover The Disk and Protect The Lab. The objective of the mission is
    still needed. The object stays with you after the Report, so a mission played again can be reported again.
  - Rayfly appears in B-2 once you hold a Computer Chip.
  - The terminal of F-3 and the sprinkler key of G-2 are checks, and their doors open with the Area F Lock Hack and the
    Sprinkler Key.
  - The lava of Area K is slow only while you hold the Lava Flow Control; the device in K-1 is a check.
  - The machines of Area E stop only while you hold the Area E Power Shutdown, a useful item; destroying the generator
    of E-3 is a check.
  - The ITEM C list of the pause menu shows the objects you hold.
- The guardians of Pass The Test answer in order, and Congre only in human form. The sprinkler key comes with eight
  people rescued, and the civilians of Area G only talk to you in human form.
- The Computer Chips, the guardians and the people of Area G are in the world only while their mission is under way.
  If you reported it first, take the mission again from the "Mission Requests" list to bring them back. The same goes for
  the terminal of F-3.
- The generator of E-3 and the lava control of K-1 go back to normal when you leave their area, as in the original game.
  With `items` the generator stays broken until the game is reset.

### The seal of Area M

- The seal a few steps into M-1 follows `area_m_access`:
  - `open` (default): it is open from the start.
  - `biometals`: it opens once the five "Obtain Biometal" checks of your own game are done: Z from Giro, and H, F, L
    and P from either Pseudoroid of each pair. Owning the biometals as items does not count.
  - `passwords`: it opens once you have received `required_passwords` Passwords out of the `total_passwords`
    shuffled into the multiworld.
- With `biometals` or `passwords` the Transerver Access of Area M is not in the pool, so nothing gets around the seal:
  Area M and N-1 (which is reached through it) stay closed until it opens. The Transerver of Area M joins your
  Transport list when you reach it on foot, as in the original game. Nothing is placed between the door of A-4
  and the seal.
- A popup announces the moment the seal opens, and its scene plays the next time you walk up to it. Each Password
  you receive is announced with its count. The pause menu and `/mmzx_goal` keep showing the goal only.
### Door constraints

- With `door_constraints_min` and `door_constraints_max` above 0, each seed locks a number of doors between rooms
  behind a Card Key, a different set every time. The Card Keys and the Transerver Access items then open the map in
  smaller steps: an area behind a locked door is still reachable through its own Transerver.
- A locked door shows the colour of its key: a coloured gate where you walk from one room into the next, and coloured
  top and bottom halves on a door you enter with UP. It opens from both sides once you have the key, like the key
  doors of the original game.
- The doors that already need a key, the doors inside a room, the Guardian Base and the Slither Inc. tower are never
  changed.
- The spoiler log lists the locked doors of every player, and Universal Tracker follows them.
- If a locked door leaves you somewhere you do not want to be, the fast travel of the MISSION tab still works.

### Cutscenes and menus

- Every story cutscene can be skipped with START, even if it is the first time you see it.


## Which difficulties and logic levels exist?

The game always runs on Normal difficulty. The logic only uses safe routes: no hard-tricks or damage boost is ever expected.
What you can tune:

- `boss_logic` (see [boss_logic.md](boss_logic.md)): for each story boss, what you must be carrying before the logic considers you able to beat it, for
  example `Hivolt: "HX & Life Up x2"`. It never restricts what you may fight in the game; it only keeps the seed from
  forcing you through a boss you are not equipped for by your own standard. A Life Up, Sub Tank or chip named in a
  requirement becomes a progression item.

## Can I play offline?

No. The client grants every item, including your own (nothing is handled locally), accepts missions and
performs the teleports. Keep it connected to the server while you play, also in a single-player game.

## Is DeathLink supported?

Yes, with the `death_link` option. Your deaths are sent, and a received death kills you as soon as you have control,
like any other death: one life is lost and you return to the last checkpoint. It is recommended to give yourself some 1-Ups
through the start inventory option in the YAML to avoid hating all your friends.

## Is there a tracker?

This randomizer is designed to be used with Universal Tracker. UT shows a map tab with the game's own world map, one map per area and one per room, switches to the
room you are in and marks your position. The world ships the map layout; the images come from the separate
[Mega Man ZX tracker pack](https://github.com/Nekusen/MegaManZX-Tracker/releases) (`mmzx_tracker.zip`, kept zipped).
UT asks for the file the first time it needs it; the [setup guide](setup_en.md) says where to set its path.
